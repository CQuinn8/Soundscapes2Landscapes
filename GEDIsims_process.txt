Here are the steps to follow, from gathering data to fitting models and visualizing results.

Gather the data: getAKNdata.R
Filter for the species we need, breeding period, desirable protocols: filterSpeciesData.R
Then assign each cell of the selected resolution and determine presence/absence for each species: attributeBirds_wStack.R
The files are ready for fitting or batch fitting all models: fitSDMmodels and fitSDMfiles .R code files, in batch mode or not, with all options or not.
