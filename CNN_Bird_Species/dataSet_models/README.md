SOUNDSCAPES TO LANDSCAPES (S2L) supporting Code, Metadata, Dataset and Models.




The S2L_45 dataset was created as a part of a larger effort of monitoring biodiversity through the Soundscapes2Landscapes (S2L) project. The project seeks to advance animal biodiversity monitoring by making use of Earth-observing satellites. The availability of inexpensive MEMS sound recorders that capture audio of sufficient quality has made possible the scaling of research from single locations and organisms, to full animal communities across landscapes. Indeed, the broad geographic scale of the Soundscapes to Landscapes (S2L) project is pioneering.

The dataset consists of two parts:

ROI set - Regions of Interests with labels are annotated by expert birders and bounded in time and frequency. Provided in zenodo are .wav files and .png melspectrograms
Golden Validation (GV) set - One-minute clips with minute-level coarse labeling of all the species present.
Number of Classes: 54
Total Number of ROIs: 79,888
Total Number of GV-set clips: 901 (?needs confirmation?)
Location: Sonoma County, CA, USA
Sites: 586 (?needs confirmation?)
Audio Recorder: AudioMoth and LG Phone Recorders (?needs confirmation?)
Sample Frequency: 48,000 Hz (?needs confirmation?)
