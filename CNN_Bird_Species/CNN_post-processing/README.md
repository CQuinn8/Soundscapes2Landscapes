### Logic of the code stack used to generate the figures and tables of the paper  
All datasets mentioned below can be found in the data folder; all R code files are in the script folder. 
The figures and tables in the paper are generated by the code file generatePlots.R. It uses the following 4 data files:  
  * ROI_GV_allmatches_011523.RData - main data file, generated by the stack of code and data files in the dataFunctions.R code file
  * audiofiles_20221216.csv - a reference table providing an AudiofileId (index) to every sampling event (i.e., audio file)
  * pattern_matching_ROIs_201109_testing.csv - the specific soundfile segment (audiofileId, start and send seconds, speciesID) set aside for testing from among all the labeled data collected for each species
  * pattern_matching_ROIs_230109_absent_testing.csv - the specific soundfile segment (audiofileId, start and send seconds, speciesID) positively identified to not contain the indicated species
