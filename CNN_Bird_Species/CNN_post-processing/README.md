### Logic of the code stack used to generate the figures and tables of the paper  
All datasets mentioned below can be found in the data folder; all R and python code files are in the script folder. 
The figures and tables in the paper are generated by the code file generateResults_tablesPlots.R. It uses the following 5 data files, which are generated by the stack of code and data files indicated below
   
__logisticCorrModels_fullHour065_predAdj65809599_lch5099_04022022.RData comes from:__
 * fit_updateLogisticCorr_models.R, which uses:
   * logCorr_modelCovarData_10222021.RData, which comes from:
     * addMoreFP_forLogisticCorr.R, which uses:
       * logisticCorr_dataPrep_utils.R
       * FPmatches_list_preTrained_06142021.RData, which comes from:
         * getROIfalsepos.R, which uses:
           * predMatching_utils.R
           * pattern_matching_ROIs_centers_210510.csv

             * withPretrain_ROI_results.R, which uses:
               * predMatching_utils.R
               * pattern_matching_ROIs_201109_testing.csv
               * pattern_matching_ROIs_centers_210510.csv
       * TPmatches_list_preTrained_06142021.RData, which comes from:
         * getROItruepos.R, which uses:
           * predMatching_utils.R
           * pattern_matching_ROIs_centers_210510.csv
           * allROI_pretrainedPredictions_210510.RData (see provenance information above)
       * logCorr_AfIds_06142021.RData - this file has the values of AudiofileIds from the database of predictions, and is also created by addMoreFP_forLogisticCorr.R and saved to avoid the time-consuming querying.
   * allmaches_65to99999_040122.RData, which comes from:
     * matchGVtoPreds_part2.R, which uses:
       * chosenSpeciesModel.RData, which comes from:
         * matchGVtoPreds_part3.R, which uses:
           * roilabelmatch.RData (see provenance information below)
   * chosenSpeciesModel.RData (see provenance information above)
   
__BirdNET_GV_matches_06102021.RData comes from:__
 * birdnet_GV_results.R, which uses:
   * predMatching_utils.R
   * pattern_matching_ROIs_centers_210510.csv
   * BirdNET_GV_preds.RData â€“ this comes from reading pickle files generated by predicting with BirdNet as specified by the authors of the model, using the containerized model prediction utility.
   * gvData_20210518.RData, which comes from:
     * makeGVdf.R, which queries the soundscape data in AirTable.
   
__performanceData.RData comes from:__
 * plotPrecisionRecall.R, which uses:
   * pickle_joblib_reader.py
   * chosenSpeciesModel.RData (see provenance information above)
   * allmaches_65to99999_040122.RData (see provenance information above)
   * roilabelmatch.RData (see provenance information below)

     * noXCmodels_results.R, which uses:
       * pattern_matching_ROIs_201109.csv
       * gvData_20210518.RData (see provenance information above)
       * pickle_joblib_reader.py
       * untraiedPredictions_gv_roi.RData (a file with the prediction data for non-pretrained models, stored in pickle files, then converted into this RData file)
       * chosenSpeciesModel.RData (see provenance information above)
   
__logisticCorrectionData.RData comes from:__
 * matchGVtoPreds_part4.R, which uses:
   * logisticCorrData_fullHour065.RData - this file is also generated by the script matchGVtoPreds_part4.R
   * allmaches_65to99999_040122.RData (see provenance information above)
   
__roilabelmatch.RData comes from:__ 
 * testVsLabels.R, which uses:
